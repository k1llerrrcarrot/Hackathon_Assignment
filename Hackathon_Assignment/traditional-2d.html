                <h1>Traditional 2D Fighting Games</h1>
                <p>The games that started it all! The goal is simple: Reduce your opponent's health to 0 by hitting them with a wide range of moves! 
                    This basic gameplay loop would be adopted by most of the sub-genres, with exception of the platform fighters.</p>

                <p>Traditional 2D Fighting Games are often characterized by relatively complicated inputs to perform special moves. 
                    This is also a tradition that is still present nowadays in this and other sub-genres. Various games have experimented with simpler input styles and over the years, 
                    while still here, inputs have become more lenient and easier to perform. The ability to execute a string of moves is seen as an important part of skill expression in the genre, 
                    which is why the complex inputs are still around.</p>
