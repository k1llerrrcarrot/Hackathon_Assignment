                <h1>3D Fighting Games</h1>
                <p>By adding another dimension to the fights, 3D Fighting games became some of the more complex sub-genres.
                    In addition to being able to jump and run toward and away from your opponent, you could now strafe around them. 
                    This opened up new options to dodge attacks but also allow you to utilize new ways of approaching your opponents.</p>

                <p>The traditional way of knocking out your opponent still exists, but this genre also introduced so-called "Ring outs", 
                    where players are able to knock an opponent over the edge of the playing field, knocking them out instantly. This added to the depth of the genre, 
                    where your overall positioning came to be very important.</p>

                <p>Some examples of 3D Fighting Games:</p>
