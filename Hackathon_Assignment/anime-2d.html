                <h1>Anime Fighters</h1>
                <p>Originating in Japan, this sub-genre was named by players in the West after the animation and drawing style that is often employed in the games. <br />
                    Another term that is often used is "Air Dashers", derived from the bigger emphasis on movement compared to the more traditional 2D sub-genre, which often means players are able to perform air-dashes.</p>

                <p>The visual style is often a large draw for these kinds of games. The evolution of graphics in videogames in general has helped immensely with the way that these games can put on screen.
                    Starting with lower resolution sprites for the characters, but with more frames of animation, the genre has grown to include high-definition sprites and even 3D animation emulating 2D animation practices!</p>
