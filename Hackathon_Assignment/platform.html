                <h1>Platform Fighters</h1>
                <p>As the youngest, but also the most popular sub-genre, platform fighters are essentially a mash-up of fighting games and platforming games, like <i>Super Mario</i>.
                With this genre, the traditional life-bars are not present, and are often replaced with a damage percentage. The higher your percentage, the easier it is to be sent flying.
                The goal is to hit the other player out of the screen to (quite literally) knock them out.</p>

                <p>Inputs in this genre are often very simple in comparison to the other sub-genres, often only consisting of holding a direction and pressing a button at the same time.
                    Attack strings, however, can still be very long and timing dependent, which makes sure that a certain degree of skill expression is still there. 
                    The popularity of platform fighters is often attributed to this lower barrier to entry, which older sub-genres have been trying to emulate. 
                </p>
